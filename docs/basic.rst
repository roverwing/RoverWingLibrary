Basic Functions
===============
This section describes basic functions provided by RoverWing library. This
documentation assumes that you have connected and initialized the RoverWing
as described in :ref:`installation` section .

All the functions and member variables described below are part of class Rover.
Thus, if you named your Rover object :code:`myRover`, then to access, say, function
:func:`begin()` you should use :func:`myRover.begin()`. Similarly, to access
class member variable ``fwVersionMajor``, use :code:`myRover.fwVersionMajor`.


General Functions
-----------------
.. function:: boolean begin()

   Initializes the RoverWing. Returns true if RoverWing was successfully
   initialized, false otherwise.

.. function:: void beginVerbose()

    More verbose version of :func:`begin`. Initializes the RoverWing and prints
    to serial monitor firmware version and voltage level. If for some reason
    initialization failed, it keeps trying until the initialization succeeds.

.. function:: String fwVersion()

   Returns firmware version (major.minor) as a string, e.g. "1.27"

.. var:: uint8_t fwVersionMajor

   Firmware major version. Note that it is a class member, not a function, so
   do not use parentheses.

.. var:: uint8_t fwVersionMinor

   Firmware minor version.



Voltage Sensing
---------------

RoverWing has a built in voltage sensing circuit which measures the supply
voltage. You can access the measurement results using the function below.
Measurements are accurate to about 2% (this is determined by the resistors
used in the circuit).

In addition, the built-in NeoPixel LED, which normally blinks green to indicate
that the firmware is loaded, can be programmed to turn yellow when the supply
voltage drops below specified threshold. To set the low voltage threshold, use
:func:`setLowVoltage` function described below.

.. function::   float getVoltage()

   Returns the RoverWing supply voltage, in volts.

.. function::  void setLowVoltage(float v)

   Sets the low voltage threshold: when the supply voltage drops below this
   value, the built-in NeoPixel LED blinks yellow.



Servos
------

RoverWing provides connection for up to four servos, using standard PWM pulse
signal. By default, RoverWing uses pulses of duration 1000us-2000us for
controlling the servos; if you are using servos with a different range, you
can change it using setServoRange command.

RoverWing provides a data type for servo names, :code:`servo_t`. It is an
enumerated type, with four different values, :code:`SERVO1, ... SERVO4`.

.. function:: void setServoRange(servo_t s, int minPulse, int maxPulse)

   Sets servo pulse operating range.

   :param int minPulse,  maxPulse:  minimal and maximal pulse duration, in
       microseconds. These values can be found in  documentation for your servo;
       typically :code:`minPulse` is between 500-1000, and
       :code:`maxPulse` is between 2000-2500. For example, for Hitec servos the
       range is 1900-2100 us.

   :param s: servo name, should be one of the four values ``SERVO1``, ... ,
       ``SERVO4``.

.. function:: void setServo(servo_t s, float position)

   Sets servo  position.

   :param s: servo name, should be one of the four values ``SERVO1``, ...,
       ``SERVO4``.

   :param float position: a number  between -1.0 and 1.0; value 0.0 corresponds
       to neutral (middle) position.

.. function:: void setAllServo(float* pos)

   Sets positions of  all four servos in a single operation.

   :param pos: an array of 4 floats: ``pos[0]`` will be used for
       ``SERVO1``, ``pos[1]`` for ``SERVO2``, etc.


RoverWing library includes an example sketch :file:`MotorsAndServosBasic`,
which illustrates the use of these functions.

Motors - Basic Usage
--------------------

RoverWing provides connections for two brushed DC motors. In this section, we
describe basic functions for controlling the motors; more advanced operations,
using closed loop control based on encoders and IMU, is described in Advanced
Motor Control section

RoverWing provides a data type for motor names, ``motor_t``. It allows just two
different values, ``MOTOR1`` and  ``MOTOR2``.

.. function::   void setMotorPwr(motor_t m, float pwr)

   Sets the power sent to a motor.

   :param m: either ``MOTOR1`` or ``MOTOR2``
   :param pwr: a number  between -1.0 (full power backwards) and 1.0
        (full power forwards). Setting power to 0 stops the motor (brake).

.. function:: void setAllMotorPwr(float pwr1, float pwr2)

   Sets power of both motors in a single operation.

   :param float pwr1, pwr2: power values for  ``MOTOR1`` and ``MOTOR2`` respectively.
       Each should be between -1.0 and 1.0

   This function checks that the inputs are between -1.0 and 1.0; if they are
   not, it automatically rescales both values to make sure they are within range
   while keeping their ratio. For example, calling ``setAllMotors(2.0,1.0)`` has the
   same effect as ``setAllMotors(1.0,0.5)``.

.. function::   void stopMotors()

   Stop both motors.

.. function::   void reverseMotor(motor_t m)

   Reverse motor direction. After using this function, power sent to the motor,
   as well as encoder readings (see below) will be multiplied by -1.


RoverWing library includes an example sketch :file:`MotorsAndServosBasic`,
which illustrates the use of these functions.

.. _encoders:

Encoders
--------

RoverWing supports quadrature encoders for each motor: if your motor is equipped
with an encoder, you can use it to get current motor position (in revolutions)
or motor speed.

Before using encoders, you need to provide some basic info about the motor
and encoder. To do that:

   1. create motor configuration data, as object of class ``motorconfig_t``, and
      set class members ``encoderCPR`` (encoder counts per revolution) and
      ``noloadRPM``.

   2. apply the configuration data to the motor(s) by calling method
      ``configureMotor``.

Below is a sample code::

   motorconfig_t myMotor;
   myMotor.encoderCPR = 1440;  //encoder counts per revolution of output shaft
   myMotor.noloadRPM = 240;    //rotation speed, in revolutions per minute (RPM) under no load
   r.configureMotor(MOTOR1, myMotor);
   r.configureMotor(MOTOR2, myMotor);


Note that "encoder counts per revolution" (CPR) should count all four types of
events generated by a quadrature encoder (rise and fall on channels A and B),
and it should be per revolution of output shaft. For example, for the Pololu
micro gear motor https://www.pololu.com/product/3051 combined with the magnetic
encoder https://www.pololu.com/product/3081, the encoder provides 12 counts per
revolution of motor shaft, and the motor contains a 75:1 gearbox, so 1
revolution of the output shaft equals 75 revolutions of the motor shaft. Thus,
the correct encoder CPR value that should be used in the configuration data is
12*75=900.

The no-load RPM is optional; it is only used for the PID speed control algorithm
as discussed in section :ref:`pid`.

After the configuration data has been applied to the motors, you can access the
motor position and speed using the functions below.

.. function::    float getPosition(motor_t m)

   Returns current motor position, in revolutions since the last encoder reset.

.. function::   void getAllPosition()

   Gets from RoverWing and saves positions of both motors. These positions can
   be accessed later via property position as described below. Using this
   function instead of :code:`getPosition(MOTOR1); getPosition(MOTOR2);` ensures
   that both positions are taken at the same moment.

.. function::   float position[2]

   Positions of motors, in revolution, fetched by :func:`getAllPosition` function.
   :code:`position[0]` holds the position of MOTOR1, and :code:`position[1]` holds
   the position of MOTOR2. Note that these values are not updated automatically:
   you need to call :func:`getAllPosition` to update them.

.. function::   float getSpeed(motor_t m)

   Returns current speed of motor ``m``, in revolutions per minute (RPM).

.. function::   void getAllSpeed()

   Gets from RoverWing and saves speeds of both motors. These speeds can be
   accessed later via property speed as described below. Using this function
   instead of ``getSpeed(MOTOR1); getSpeed(MOTOR2);`` ensures that both speeds
   are taken at the same moment.

.. function::   float speed[2]

   Speeds of motors, in RPM, fetched by :func:`getAllSpeed` function.
   ``speed[0]`` holds speed of ``MOTOR1``, and ``speed[1]`` holds speed of
   ``MOTOR2``. Note that these values are not updated automatically: you
   need to call :func:`getAllSpeed` to update them.

.. function::   void resetEncoder(motor_t m)

   Resets the encoder for motor ``m``.

.. function:: void resetAllEncoder()

   Resets the encoders for both motors.

Analog Sensors
--------------

RoverWing provides 6 analog inputs, using 10-bit analog to digital converter.
You can access these values using the functions below.

.. function:: float getAnalog(uint8_t i)

   Returns reading of analog input ``i``, in volts. Note: index ``i``
   ranges between 1-6, not 0-5!

.. function::    float getAllAnalog()

   Gets from RoverWing and saves readings of all 6 analog inputs. These readings
   can be later accessed using property analog below. Using this function is
   faster than using six different ``getAnalog(i)`` calls; it also ensures that
   all readings are taken at the same moment, which is important if you want to
   compare them.

.. function::   float analog[]

   Array of analog readings fetched by :func:`getAllAnalog` function. ``analog[1]``
   holds the reading of analog input 1 (in volts), etc. Note that these values
   are not automatically updated: you must call :func:`getAllAnalog` function
   to update them. Also, note that you should use indexes starting with 1, not
   0.

..  note::

   The values returned by these functions are not raw values: RoverWing uses
   a "low-pass" filter. Slightly simplifying, one can say that this filter,
   instead of returning the results of last reading, returns an average of
   several last readings. This helps reduce random noise but also introduces a
   small delay (about 1 ms) in registering changes in analog readings.

Sonars
------

RoverWing supports up to three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors (sonars). These
inexpensive sensors are available from a variety of sources, for example
Sparkfun and Amazon. The firmware operates the sonars in continuous mode,
cycling all active sonars: after one sonar receives an echo, the distance is to
the object is computed and saved and the next available sonar is triggered and
sends a sound ping. This process repeats until :func:`stopSonars` command is
received.

At startup, no sonars are active; to activate some of the sonars, you need to
call :func:`activateSonars` function.

RoverWing provides a data type for sonar names, ``sonar_t``. It allows three
different values, ``SONAR1``, ``SONAR2``, ``SONAR3``.

As with the analog inputs, sonar readings are passed through a low-pass filter,
to smooth out random noise.

.. function::   void activateSonars(uint8_t bitmask, int maxDistance=6000)

   Activates sonars.

   :param bitmask:  which sonars should be activated (least significant bit for
       ``SONAR1``, next bit for ``SONAR2``, etc). The easiest way is to use
       predefined values ``SONAR1``, ``SONAR2``, ``SONAR3`` which are defined in
       such a way that calling ``activateSonars(SONAR1)`` activates ``SONAR1``.
       Moreover, they can be added together to form any combination: for
       example, to activate sonars 1 and 3, use
       ``activateSonars(SONAR1+SONAR3)``.
   :param int maxDistance: (optional) specifies maximal distance to an object in mm and
       is used to determine the timeout time: if no echo is received in the
       time required for the sound to reach object at this distance and return,
       then we stop waiting for echo. In this case the function returns
       value  ``maxDistance``.

.. function:: void stopSonars()

   Stops all sonars.

.. function:: float getSonar(sonar_t s)

   Get latest distance reading of sonar ``s``.

.. function::   void getAllSonar()

   Gets the latest readings of all active sonars from the RoverWing and saves
   them. These values can be later accessed using ``sonar[]`` property

.. function::   float sonar[3]

   Array of sonar readings fetched by getAllSonar() function, in mm. ``sonar[0]``
   holds reading for sonar 1, etc. Note that these values are not automatically
   updated: you must call :func:`getAllAnalog` function to update them.

.. _neopixel:

NeoPixel
--------

RoverWing allows connecting a strip of "smart" LEDs, using WS2812b or SK6812
chips. These LEDs, commonly called "NeoPixels", contain small chips which make
them individually addressable: you can independently set colors of different
LEDs using just one data line. You can read more about them in
Adafruit's Uberguide: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide.
Note that RoverWing only allows the RGB NeoPixels; RGB W NeoPixels, which add
white LED to the usual RGB, are not supported.

RoverWing allows you to connect a strip of up to 255 NeoPixels. However, the
more NeoPixels you connect, the more power they consume, and the longer it takes
to update the whole strip, so please check the power requirements specified in
|guide| if you intend to use more than 20-30 NeoPixels.

Note that RoverWing also contains an internal NeoPixel LED, which blinks green
to indicate normal operation, or yellow to indicate low supply voltage. This
NeoPixel can not be directly controlled by the user (other than setting the low
voltage threshold as described in section `Voltage Sensing`_.

.. function::    void setPixelCount(uint8_t n)

   Sets the number of NeoPixels connected to the RoverWing (up to 255)

.. function::   void setPixelBrightness(uint8_t b)

   Sets brightness for all NeoPixels (including the internal one). Brightness
   can range from 0-255; usually, brightness of 32 (1/8 of maximum) is bright
   enough.

   This setting (as well as colors of individual pixels set using ``setPixelRGB()``
   and ``setPixelHSV()`` functions) is not applied immediately; you need to call
   :func:`showPixel` function to apply them.

.. function   void setPixelRGB(uint8_t i, uint8_t R, uint8_t G, uint8_t B)

   Sets color of ``i``-th pixel, using three values for red, blue, and green colors,
   each ranging 0-255. Note that index ``i`` ranges from 1-255, not from 0.

   This color is not applied immediately: see description of :func:`showPixel`
   function below.

.. function::   void setPixelColor(uint8_t i, uint32_t c)

   Sets the color of ``i``-th pixel.    This color is not applied immediately:
   see description of :func:`showPixel`   function below.


   :param i: pixel index, ranging 1-255
   :param c: color in the usual hexadecimal notation: ``c=0xRRGGBB`` (see,
       e.g., https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).
       You can also use one of the named values for color: ``RED``, ``GREEN``,
       ``BLUE``, ``WHITE``, ``YELLOW``, ``OFF``.

.. function:: void setPixelHSV(uint8_t i, uint8_t H, uint8_t S, uint8_t V)

   Sets color of i-th pixel, using Hue, Saturation, and Value (see, e.g.,
   https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp), each ranging 0-255. As
   before, ``i`` starts with 1 and the color change is not applied immediately.

.. function::   void showPixel()

   After setting individual pixel colors using any combination of functions
   above, call this function to apply all changes at once.
