/*
RoverWing Neopixel  test

This code is part of RoverWing library: https://github.com/roverwing

It can be used with any Adafruit Feather board (or compatible) plugged into
RoverWing  board. RoverWing board can be powered through the main power connector,
or it can get power from the Feather. The voltage readings returned by getVoltage()
measure voltage at main power connector; they are useless if RoverWing is
powered by the  Feather board.

This example expects that you have connected a string of Neopixels (3 color only - no white)
to the neopixel port of the RoverWing; max allowed is 45 pixels.
