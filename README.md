RoverWing Arduino Library
=========================
An Arduino Library for [RoverWing](https://roverwing-board.readthedocs.io), a
robotics  extension board   for Adafruit's Feather boards. RoverWing  
provides motor drivers, Inertial Motion Unit (IMU), and connection ports for
servos, sonars, GPS,and other peripherals commonly used by mobile robots.
It also contains a microcontroller preloaded with firmware to control these
peripherals, which communicates with the Feather board using I2C protocol,
thus freeing resources of the Feather board for other purposes.

This repository contains an Arduino library necessary to access all features of
RoverWing. Detailed documentation, including installation instructions, is
available at http://roverwing-library.readthedocs.io.
